# Multi-Signal Risk Strategy

Given evaluation results:

- Rule 1 HIGH band demonstrates meaningful precision.
- Rule 2 shows limited standalone predictive strength.

Therefore, the final risk strategy adopts a layered approach:

1. Structuring acts as the primary alert generator.
2. Velocity acts as a behavioural enrichment signal.
3. Accounts flagged by both rules receive elevated investigative priority.

This mirrors production AML systems where:

- Deterministic rules detect clear anomalies.
- Behavioural rules enhance contextual risk.
- Combined signals drive case prioritisation.
